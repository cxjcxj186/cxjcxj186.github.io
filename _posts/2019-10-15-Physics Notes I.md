## 前言



## Mechanics

The mechanics statue of a particle is determined by its position and velocity. Thus a function L(q,\dot{q},t) is enough to derive mechanics principles. The actual mechanics happens when the action $S[L]$ takes its extreme. This derives the Euler-Lagrange equation. In certain cases, it is the motion equation for a particle or a system. It is a system of $s$ second-order equations.

To derive the Lagrangian for a system, we use the symmetry of the space-time. In practice, just apply the canonical Lagrangian and make a change of variable. Note that for a system, $L=\sum \frac{1}{2}m_\alpha v_\alpha^2-U$, while the energy is $E=\sum \frac{1}{2}m_\alpha v_\alpha^2 +U$.

Another way to study mechanics is, instead of considering $L$, we consider a function of momentum and speed
$$H=\sum p_i\dot{q}_i-L$$
Then we have the canonical equations, which is a system of $2s$ first-order equations.

## Electrodynamics

## Relativity

The principle of relativity and finiteness of transition speed. Since the speed is finite, the space and time are there related. Time flows in different speed in different frames. The form $ds^2=\sum dx_i^2-c^2dt^2$ will be an invariant in this setting.
