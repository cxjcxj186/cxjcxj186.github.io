## 前言


Quantum mechanics, especially the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, is not compatible with (special) relativity. To combine these two theories, some more work is needed.

In quantum field theory, fields, including particle fields or force fields, are the fundamental objects. A field is always existing, its vibrations produces particles. A quantized field is a synthesis of continuity and discreteness. The quantization of a EM field is the quantum eleltrodynamics, the resulting particle is a photon. Photon is massless, so it has no feeling of time, and its speed is the maximal speed in relativity. The field for gravity is the spacetime itself, but quantization is too difficult. The theory of strong interaction is quantum chromodynamics. The interaction of difficult fields gives the physical quantities and properties, this is why interaction theory os so important.

Computational skills: perturbation theory, Feynman diagrams. Renormalization.

String theory: hidden dimensions: Calabi-Yau manifolds.

Mirror symmetry, duality: different models give the same physical picture. Gauge theory, symmetries determine fundamental forces.
