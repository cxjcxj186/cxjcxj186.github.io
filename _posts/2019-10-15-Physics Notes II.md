## 前言
量子力学量力学

In classical mechanics, the position and velocity totally determine the state of an object. But in quantum mechanics, these two cannot be measured simultaneously. Therefore, an object does not have an explicit orbit.

The position and other physical quantity are expressed by a wave function, its integration determines the probability. Although we cannot determine the motion (or even the state) of an object, the wave function can be explicitly determined by the wave equation

$$i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=\hat{H}\psi$$

where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian, which is an Hermitian operator.

\textit{superposition principle}

A physical quantity is represented by an Hermitian operator $f$. Its eigenvalues $f_n$ are the possible values , while the corresponding eigenvectors $\phi_n$ are the corresponding wave functions. By superposition principle, the wave function for any state is a linear combination of eigen-wave functions.
