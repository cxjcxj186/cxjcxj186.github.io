# Fields and field extensions

The object of number theory are fields and their relations (that is, extensions). That why we care about structure theory for local and global fields, and ramification theory.

## Structure theory I: Local fields

## Structure theory II: Global fields

## Extension theory: Ramification

# Class field theory

## Group cohomology
 
 The group cohomology and homology can be considered as the same object, and connected by Tate..
 
# L-functions
