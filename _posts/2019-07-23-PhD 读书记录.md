打个表格，来记录一下读书。书名，作者，完成日期，以及对于书本身的评价。关于内容的整理可以以别的形式按照需求记录。期望毕业的时候可以打出好几页的单子，那是这几年的心血。

## 数学

What will I learn??

Singular spaces: (topology) perverse sheaves, IH theory; (geometry) derived category and duality; (linear algebra) mixed Hodge structures, variations; resolution of singularities; Moduli spaces, Neron models, motives,K-theory... 

Number theory: arithmetic applications..

Examples: Curves; Surfaces; Special classes: Abelian varieties, Fano, toric, Calabi-Yau (K3 surface), hypersurfaces with certain degrees...
