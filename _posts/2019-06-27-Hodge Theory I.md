## 前言

K\"{a}hler manifolds, in particular projective manifolds, are excellent objects whose geometry has more algebraic structures. The interplay between differential geometry and algebra leads to the Hodge theory of k\"{a}hler manifolds which states the algebraic structures on the cohomology groups: Hodge decomposition and Hodge diamonds, the natural $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-action and Lefschetz decomposition, Riemann-Hodge bilinear relations. These algebraic structures are Hodge structures, and morphism of k\"{a}hler manifolds induces morphism of Hodge structures. Explicit computations need more techniques, but the general story for a single k\"{a}hler manifold comes to the end.
